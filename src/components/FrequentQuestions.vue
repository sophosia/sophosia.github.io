  <h4 class="bold">Frequent questions</h4>
  <div class="items-start">
    <div class="fq-question">
      How does it differ from other reference Manager, say Zotero?
    </div>
    <div class="fq-answer">
      While Zotero specialized in reference management. Sophosia gives you an
      integrated experience of note-taking and reference-managing.
    </div>
    <div class="fq-question">How do I sync data among devices?</div>
    <div class="fq-answer">
      Unlike other reference managers, all of Sophosia's data is stored in a
      hidden folder in the user selected storage path. Meaning that sophosia can
      replicate the state on different machines as long as the hidden folder is
      there. This is particularly friendly to Free syncing technology like
      Syncthing.

    <div class="fq-question">Cannot verify developer while installing?!</div>
    <div class="fq-answer">
      It's not a virus! I just didn't bother to buy digital licenses on Windows
      and macOS for my application in this early stage. I will buy licenses once
      this project gets enough traction.
    </div>
    <div class="fq-question">Can I export PDF with annotations?</div>
    <div class="fq-answer">
      In my knowledge, LaTeX supported annotation is only available in Sophosia,
      it is not a standard feature of many PDF viewers. Currently we don't
      support exporting PDF with annotations.
    </div>
    <div class="fq-question">
      Can I edit PDF, markdown and excalidraw files in other applications?
    </div>
    <div class="fq-answer">
      Yes. Sophosia is designed in a file-centric way, you can edit PDFs / notes
      in your favorite applications without worrying data conflict between
      applications.
    </div>
    <div class="fq-question">Is there a plugin system?</div>
    <div class="fq-answer">
      Yes. The prototype of plugin system has already been tested in the beta
      version, previously named
      <a href="https://github.com/ResearchHelper/research-helper">
        Research Helper
      </a>
      . Yet, We need to improve the plugin system structure and Sophosia APIs
      before user can actually use it.
